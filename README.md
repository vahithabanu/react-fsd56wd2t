# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



ReactJs
-IS an open source javascripy library for building user interfaces and single-page applications(SPAs).
-it is maintained by facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
-It is used for its simplicity,faster performance,scalability and flexibility.


## Features
-Compenent -based architecture
    React uses a component-based architecture to buld complex user interfaces.It allows you to break down your appln into smaller,reusable components,which make it easier to manage and maintain your code.

-Virtual DOM(Virtual Document Object Model)
    React uses a virtual DOM to improve the performance of your appln.It creates a lightweight copy of the actual DOM and updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed.This makes your appln fstsre and more efficient.

-JSX(Javascriot XML)
    -React uses JSX,a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your javascript files.This makes your code more readable and easier to understand.
    -JSx will then be transofmed into regular javascript using a transpiler like babel.

-State Management
    React provides a simple and efficient way to manage the states of your appln.It allows you to create and update the state of your components,which makes it easier to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
